##### Start

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Algo basic array and anagram problem.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a lot with finding the optimal solution for it best time to buy and sell stock an easy problem. Valid Anagram took a while to solve because tried a different approach that I had doubted but still did it. Should have just followed my gut.
