### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 5: February 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued on yesterdays Algo problem and finished new portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed these problems more but maybe because I actually new where to start. Portfolio might be to simple now and I didnt do many changes to the template hope that doesn't count against me.

### Day 4: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued on yesterdays Algo problem and started new portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I still struggled with the Algo Problem it was pretty hard for me even though I worked on it yesterday. I choose a very basic template to use for our new portfolio going for more minimalistic not going to have a lot more just links.

### Day 3: February 17, 2021 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Algo basic array.

**Thoughts:** - had a hard time figuring how to do the efficent way instead of setting up loops and just going around. I knew there had to be a better way but couldnt come up with it

### Day 2: February 16, 2021 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Algo basic array and Math problem.

**Thoughts:** felt like product of array was more of a math question and had a hard time figuring it out

1. [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
2. [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

### Day 1: February 15, 2021 
##### Start

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Algo basic array and anagram problem.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a lot with finding the optimal solution for it best time to buy and sell stock an easy problem. Valid Anagram took a while to solve because tried a different approach that I had doubted but still did it. Should have just followed my gut.
